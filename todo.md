[ ] - currently have to modify ./index.html
  - copy over the contents of /build/index.html
  - update ./index.html paths to point to ./build/
  - in main.######.chunk.js, update the path to any assets in build/static/media by prefixing with build/, e.g. build/static/media/image.png
[ ] - set the title dynamically so I don't have to change "React App" to "Shawn Roller"
[ ] - favicon
